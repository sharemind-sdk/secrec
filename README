System requirements
-------------------

Compiling this code requires the following:
 * Qt SDK version 4.4 or later with qmake
 * GNU Bison (version 2.4.2 should do, earlier version may also work)
 * Flex (version 2.5.35 should do, earlier version may also work)
 * A make tool (e.g. gmake) supported by the Qt SDK used
 * Compilers for C and C++ code
   * Some GNU Compiler Collection versions earlier than 4.3.4 are known not to
     work at this moment.


Compile instructions
--------------------

The root directory of the source code is the directory where the file scc.pro,
COMPILING etc reside. To compile the code, the following commands must be run in
that directory:

  qmake
  make

*** NOTE: Under some systems one may have to run qmake-qt4 instead of qmake. ***

If compiling was successful, the generated dynamic library should reside in the
lib/ subdirectory and the generated command-line tools should reside in the bin/
subdirectory.



Running sca
-----------

A wrapper bash script for running the SecreC Analyzer (sca) is in the root
directory of the source code. It can be used to run bin/sca from that directory
without the hassle of manually setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to point to
subdirectory lib/ in the root directory of the source code. Besides setting the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, running the wrapper should have the same
functionality as running the analyzer directly.

The analyzer (and hence also the wrapper script) can be invoked either by
specifying a filename of the file to analyze as the first parameter on the
command line or by running it with no parameters in which case the input is read
from standard input.
