If you want to create documentation, where "Related Pages" is called "Language reference".

1.
download the latest SOURCE from 
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html 

2.
extract files and go to the folder
../doxygen-x.x.x/src
open the file "translator_en.h"

3.
find the line that says:

{ return "Related pages"; }

change it to:

{ return "Language reference"; }

save and close the file

4. 
open your terminal at the
doxygen-x.x.x directory
run the configure script:

"sh ./configure"

* if doxygen throws errors, install whatever packages it needs(dot,perl,flex,bison) via the package manager.
next compile doxygen:

"make"

and finally install doxygen:

"make install"

5.
The last thing that needs to be done, is to make sure the files "Create_Documentation.sh" and "Doxyfile" are in the same folder and that
if you open "Doxyfile" the dirs on line 660 are correct for your version of sharemind. If all that is correct go to the directory where those 2 files are and write:

"./Create_Documentation.sh"

the folder "html" should appear in your current directory.
